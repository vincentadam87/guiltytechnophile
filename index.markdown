Welcome to my blog!

I am a cognitive scientist and machine learning researcher, excited about digital technologies as tools for positive change.

Digital technologies have brought some undeniable possibilities - like writing this blog, but also bring their share of threats and misery.

The reasons for the latter are not mysterious. There are misaligned financial incentives, with online services designed to maximize engagement and not human flourishing. There are myths and ideologies about technology, how we ought to develop and use it. There are unexpected emergent properties of our interactions with technology as we try new tools with no precedent in human history.

Unpacking these is a multifaceted journey through technology, history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, anthropology and more.

I want to share this journey, discussing books and news related to the topic, and some consequences on both the individual and collective levels.
